### 1. Choosing a Path
You can go through the image below to understand the paths that you can take in your Azure journey.
![Azure Paths](https://github.com/AbdulMutakabbir/Get-Azure-Certification-Free/blob/main/assets/azure-certification-path-2020.png)
Even though there are many possible paths available for you, we will be focusing on the Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) certification examination as it is the starting point for any beginner and also gives you a complete overview of the functionalities, features, and tools that Azure has to offer. This process can be applied to any of Microsoft's Azure certifications.

### 2. Learning Material
You can find the All the learning material you need along with any practice lab for your certification for free at [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/). All you need to do is create (or login to) your Microsoft Account at no charge. Once you have done that you would need to search for your Certification (in this case AZ-900) and go through all the modules in each of the learning paths for that certification.

### 3. Practice Material
Once you have gone through all the learning paths for your certification you would need to some practice before you attempt the examination. There are many Sources/Training Materials/Courses/Practice Materials available out there but most of them are either paid or give you partial access to the material. 
I have listed below a list of all the two websites where you can find the material for free. 
* The first one provides you with limited questions access but is good to understand the exam pattern and flow
* The second one provides a complete exam questions dump but you would not understand the exam pattern.
for this reason, it is important to go through both of the links.

### 4. Certifiaction
Now that you have learned everything and had a practice for the examination all free of cost, you now are ready to attempt the exam but, the certification costs some amount depending on where you live. There is a way around it too and here's what you would need to do. You would need to browse the [Microscoft Training Day](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trainingdays) website to find and register for your specific certification. Once you have done that you will be provided a coupon to use that gives you 100% off on the course you registered for. The coupon will be active 5 days after the training has completed. It is not necessary that you find the training in your country or language all you need is the coupon which can be achieved once you register and go through the training.
